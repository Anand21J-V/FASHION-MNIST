The Fashion MNIST dataset is a large freely available database of fashion images that is commonly used for training and testing various machine learning systems.[1][2] Fashion-MNIST was intended to serve as a replacement for the original MNIST database for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits.[3]

The dataset contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of fashion products from 10 categories from a dataset of Zalando article images, with 7,000 images per category.[1] The training set consists of 60,000 images and the test set consists of 10,000 images. The dataset is commonly included in standard machine learning libraries.
